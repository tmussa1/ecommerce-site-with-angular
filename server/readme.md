# Assignment #5 - REST APIs

This assignment performs all four CRUD operations. I have tested them using PostMan and clientside Javascript that I included, testAPI.js. To test the API, you need to click on the TEST API button testAPI.html and this actions will be performed in order.

1) Listing the items in the database
2) Creating a product
3) Retreiving the product that was just created
4) Updating some of the fields in the product
5) Finally, deleting the product
